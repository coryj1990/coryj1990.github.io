So far in working with Jekyll I haven't had to use any specific coding languages to make these pages
come to life. I may have only looked at what Jekyll does in the last few days before starting this 
example up, but I would expect to find some place in the file structure, similar to a model folder in rails,
soon. I would find it hard to believe if this product doesn't have some form of logic somewhere. A few other 
things I am impressed by are the auto regenerations of edited files will appear by refreshing that
page with no requirement to restart the server. Another feature is the _layouts. From what I have read it is 
implied that the content above and below this are stored somewhere in the file structure. Previously I worked 
with not as intuitive frameworks which did seperate the main page's materail from a heading or menu, but I look forward to investigating where and how I can adjust the page content. An example of showing ruby code is below.


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
